# CLI-donut
Trying to create a spinning donut in CLI with C

The objective of this little project to create the animation of a spinning donut in terminal but with a small twist.
The thing is, a simple spinning donut is not impressive nor is it new. So this one will have ajustable speed and sizing
dynamicly in the animation. This is possible with a fork that handles input reading and transfers the data back to the main program
with a pipe.



How to use:

1. make

2. ./donut

3. The commands are a and d to change the speed and j and l for the size of the donut.

4. DO NOT FORGET TO USE C TO CLOSE THE PROGRAM AND NOT WITH OTHER MEANS (to close the fork).
